# 👋 Welcome to SPARROW

**SPARROW**, developed by **Microsoft's AI for Good Lab**, is an **AI-powered edge computing solution** designed to monitor and protect wildlife in the most remote regions of the world. 

Solar-powered and equipped with advanced sensors, it collects biodiversity data—from camera traps, acoustic monitors, and other environmental detectors—that are processed using our most advanced PyTorch-based wildlife AI models on power efficient edge GPUs. 

The resulting critical information is then transmitted via low-Earth orbit satellites directly to the cloud or on-premise infrastructure, allowing researchers to access fresh, actionable insights in real time, no matter where they are.

To learn more about project SPARROW, please checkout our SPARROW paper here 👉 [aka.ms/sparrowpaper](https://aka.ms/sparrowpaper)

# ✨ Key Features

1. **🔋 Autonomous operation**  
   Intelligent power management with solar charging, battery health monitoring, and dynamic component scheduling enables continuous off-grid operation.

2. **📷 Sensing**  
   Camera traps, acoustic monitoring, and environmental sensors - SPARROW integrates multi-modal sensing to capture images, sounds, and enviromental metrics for comprehensive biodiversity monitoring.

3. **🧠 On-device AI**  
   Runs optimized PyTorch Wildlife models on power efficient edge GPUs (e.g., Jetson Orin Nano) for real-time image and acoustic detection, species classification, and event recognition.

4. **🌐 Global connectivity**  
   Even in the most remote ecosystems, SPARROW maintains a link to the cloud or on-premise infrastructure through low-Earth-orbit satellites, ensuring that vital conservation data reaches researchers in near real time.

5. **🛡️ Resilience**  
   Designed for extreme field conditions - SPARROW safely records data when offline, automatically synchronizing once connectivity is restored to ensure no loss of information.

### ⚠️ Important Note on Alternative I²C Boards
If you choose to use generic I²C boards, please be aware that some modifications to the device address in the code 🔍 may be necessary. Different vendors often assign addresses that vary from those provided in this release.
For simplicity and flexibility, we adopted the Mikroe MikroBUS standard ✅, which greatly reduces the barrier to entry thanks to its ease of assembly 🔧 and standardized interface.
Our assembly guide 📖 was drafted using Mikroe Click boards, so if you opt for generic I²C boards, expect additional steps not covered in the guide. This approach is recommended only for advanced users 🛠️ familiar with hardware integration and troubleshooting. 

Generic boards may require custom wiring and code adjustments beyond what is documented here.

💡 Tip: To ensure a smooth experience, we strongly recommend starting with MikroBUS-compatible modules unless you have prior technical experience with I²C board assemblies, I²C address mapping and board-specific configurations.

### 🏗️ Hardware Assembly Instructions
Follow this step-by-step guide to assemble your SPARROW device with ease. We designed the process around the Mikroe MikroBUS standard for maximum flexibility and simplicity, reducing the skill barrier for new users. Each step includes clear visuals and tips to ensure proper installation of components like sensors, connectors, and power modules. 

⚠️ If you choose alternative boards or custom configurations, additional steps may be required and are not covered in this guide. For best results, start with the recommended components and verify connections before powering up. 🔌

## ⚡ 2. One-click Jetson Setup (Recommended)

The repo contains a Jetson configuration script `sparrow_setup.sh` that installs prerequisites, prepares folders, downloads default Triton models, seeds the DS3231 RTC, configures Wi-Fi hotspot, and launches the SPARROW services.

To send data to the SPARROW dashboard you will need to pair it with your account.  
To create an account and obtain an access key visit:  
[https://dashboard.sparrow-earth.com/](https://dashboard.sparrow-earth.com/)

📄 [View the SPARROW dashboard Terms & Conditions](https://dev.sparrow-earth.com/agreement)

**Script:** Download the SPARROW setup script from this repo once the hardware assembly and Jetson flash is complete (detailed instructions can be found in the build instructions).  
The setup script should be run from `~/Desktop`.

### ▶️ Usage

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
sudo chmod +x sparrow_setup.sh
sudo ./sparrow_setup.sh

```

## What the Script Does

### 1️⃣ Prereqs & Tooling
Installs:
```
docker, docker-compose, git, curl, wget, uuidgen, smbus2
```

### 2️⃣ Device Identity
Generates `/etc/unique_id` if missing (single-line UUID).

### 3️⃣ Folder Layout (Host)
Creates `~/Desktop/system` with:
```
/system
├── docker-compose.yml
├── sparrow_setup.sh
├── Models/
│   └── tritonserver/
│       └── model_repository/

│       └── gallery/
└── starlink/
    ├── Dockerfile.starlink
    ├── config/
    │   └── access_key.txt
    └── logs/

```

### 4️⃣ Models + Configs
Downloads three default ONNX models from Zenodo and writes minimal `config.pbtxt` for each Triton repo.

### 5️⃣ Access Key
Prompts for the server access key (obtained from the SPARROW dashboard) and writes it to:
```
sparrow/config/access_key.txt
starlink/config/access_key.txt
```

### 6️⃣ RTC Seeding (DS3231 over I2C bus 7)
Gets UTC from WorldClock API (fallback: NTP or system UTC) and writes it to the RTC.

### 7️⃣ Wi-Fi Hotspot
Configures a persistent hotspot via NetworkManager:  
**SSID:** `CameraTraps`  
**Password:** `User prompted`

### 8️⃣ Docker Build & Launch
Builds images with BuildKit (no cache), runs `docker-compose up -d`, and tails logs.

# 🧩 Software Dependencies

All Python dependencies are inside the containers (no host Python required):

1. `PyTorch`, `torchaudio`, `tritonclient`, `aiosmtpd`, `psutil`, `smbus2`, `pyserial`, etc.  
2. **NVIDIA Triton Inference Server** (explicit model control mode)  
3. **Hardware:** I2C, ALSA audio, and USB serial (compose is configured privileged)

# ⁉️ SPARROW FAQs
<details>
<summary> 🦜 What is SPARROW and what does it do? </summary>

The **Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation Watch (SPARROW)** is an AI-powered computing solution designed to operate autonomously in the location where it is installed to monitor and collect data on biodiversity of the area.  Data is collected from camera traps, acoustic monitors, and other environmental detectors, and then processed using wildlife AI models. SPARROW is solar-powered so that it can be used in remote areas without easy access to power sources. Data can be transmitted to the cloud via satellites, allowing researchers to transfer data to the SPARROW Dashboard, or other personal dashboards, and further analyze and gain insights on their data from anywhere.   
</details>

<details>
<summary> 🤖 How do the AI models work?</summary>

AI models can take in different kinds of information like pictures, sounds, and sensor readings and look for patterns that help them understand what’s happening. For example, they can recognize objects in images, detect sounds in audio, or spot unusual readings in telemetry data. The AI models that run on SPARROW analyze the collected data to determine if the images should be kept and uploaded.  
</details>

<details>
<summary> 🛡️ How does SPARROW handle privacy and human-related data?</summary>

SPARROW includes scrubbing software that will delete any inadvertently collected human-related data off of the device.  Additionally, the Microsoft Dashboard includes scrubbing software that runs over the data that is uploaded to remove or anonymize any human-related data. If, after scrubbing, Microsoft personnel find any human-related data, it will be deleted.  You can also delete data off of your device or the Microsoft Dashboard by going to the gallery and deleting the associated files. The vision system looks at images and tries to recognize people by comparing what it sees with patterns it has seen previously. When it detects a person, the system calculates a confidence score (basically, how sure it is that it has found a match). If the score is high enough, the image is removed or anonymized.  
</details>

<details>
<summary> ⚠️ Can I remove the scrubbing software?</summary>

Microsoft **does not** recommend removal of scrubbing software on your device.  Data uploaded to the Microsoft Dashboard will be scrubbed of personally identifiable information regardless of SPARROW device scrubbing.  Dashboard scrubbing and privacy features cannot be altered or removed. 
</details>

<details>
<summary> 📬 How can I contact support for issues or privacy concerns?</summary>

For dashboard-related issues, Microsoft trademark authorization, privacy concerns, or general feedback, use the **contact form** under the “About” menu in the SPARROW dashboard. For development or client-specific issues, reach out via the **GitHub page**.
